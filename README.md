# Project Name: Chada Tech Clock
## Summary

This project aims to create a clock program that displays both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. Users have the option to add seconds, minutes, and hours dynamically and see the updates reflected on both clock formats.


### Key Features

- Dual clock display: 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
- Dynamic time addition: Allows users to add seconds, minutes, and hours.
- Real-time updates: Changes are immediately reflected on both clock displays.

### Achievements
I successfully implemented a functional clock program that accurately updates based on user inputs. This ensures that both the 12-hour and 24-hour clocks display the correct time after modifications.

### Areas for Improvement

To enhance user experience, I plan to:

- Improve user-friendliness: Display the updated clocks after each input for immediate feedback.
- Streamline navigation: Simplify menu options to reduce the need for users to repeat selections.

### Challenges and Solutions
The initial challenge was figuring out the structure of the program. I overcame this by creating a detailed flowchart to map out all possible user interactions and program outcomes. This helped me implement the necessary functionalities effectively.

### Transferable Skills

Skills gained from this project include:

- Utilizing flowcharts for program design.
- Enhancing code readability and user-friendliness.
- Modularizing code for adaptability and maintainability.

### Code Maintainability

The program is designed to be easily modifiable and understandable:

- Sections of the code are well-commented for clarity.
- Modular approach allows for straightforward updates and adaptations.
