1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    a) Project One was to create a clock that showed a 12 hour format and a 24 hour format that provided options to the user          to either add a second, a minute, and an hour and then to reflect that update on both clocks.
2) What did you do particularly well?
    a) I believe I created a clock that prodiced the correct results based on the users selections and inputs.
3) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    a) I think making my code a but more user freindly would enhance it and being able to display the clock after every input         would make it more user freidnly as well. It would help the user to see if something was incorrect right away instead          of having to go through the menu options all over again.
4) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are     you adding to your support network?
      a) The hardest thing for me is figuring out where to start, but once I do, I can get going and then improve my code               later. For this project specifically, I relied on my flowchart heavily to make sure I had all the correct options and          even tried to go above and beyond. 
5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    a) Utilizing flowcharts will always be helpful and a good place to start. Being able to read my code in order to make it          more userfriendly will also help in the future.
6) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    a) I think this program is easily modifiable if needed and everything is sectioned out with comments to help make it              readable.
